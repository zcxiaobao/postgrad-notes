title: Neural NILM Deep Neural Networks Applied to Energy Disaggregation
lang: en-US

1.  We compare two benchmark disaggregation algorithms (combinatorial optimisation and factorial hidden Markov models) to the disaggregation performance of our three deep neural nets using seven metrics.

    我们比较了两种基准分解算法(组合优化和阶乘隐马尔可夫模型)与使用7个指标的3个深度神经网络的分解性能

2. By definition, small appliances do not consume much energy individually but modern homes tend to have a large number of such appliances so their combined consumption can be significant. Hence it would be useful to detect small appliances using NILM. We have not explored whether our neural nets perform well on ‘small’ appliances but we plan to in the future.

    根据定义，小家电单个并不消耗很多能源，但现代家庭往往有大量这样的家电，所以它们的总消耗量可能很大。因此，使用NILM检测小型设备是很有用的。我们还没有探索我们的神经网络是否在“小型”设备上表现良好，但我们计划在未来这样做。
3. We found that synthetic data acts as a regulariser. In other words, training on a mix of synthetic and real aggregate data rather than just real data appears to improve the net’s ability to generalise to unseen houses. 

    我们发现，合成数据起到了调节作用。换句话说，混合使用合成的和真实的汇总数据而不仅仅是真实的数据进行训练，似乎可以提高网络对看不见的房屋进行归纳的能力。

1. We have done some preliminary experiments and found that neural nets appear to be able to generalise better if we independently centre each sequence. But there are likely to be ways to have the best of both worlds: i.e. to give the network information about the absolute power whilst also allowing the network to generalise well.

    我们已经做了一些初步实验，发现如果我们独立地集中每个序列，神经网络似乎能够更好地泛化。但有可能有办法两全其美:即给网络关于绝对权力的信息，同时也允许网络很好地概括。
